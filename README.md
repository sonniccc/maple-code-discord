# Discord Bot

Date Created: 6th December 2025

The goal is to implement a Discord bot that automatically retrieves and aggregates all chat data from the Maple Code Discord server.

The bot will:

- Scrape all archived chat content inside the Maple Coding Discord server.
- Export the scraped chat data to another server.
- Store all exported information in a separate server location.
- Delete the old channels once their content has been scraped and archived.
